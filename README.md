## What's that?

An other css grid system...

This is a very simple css grid system that is EXTREMELY lightweight (~5ko).
There are 2 different sizes:

* screen width > 768px: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 items per lines
 
* screen width < 768px:
 * 1 item per line
 * force 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 items per lines

This grid is easy to use for begginers, and easy to customize for confirmed developpers.
